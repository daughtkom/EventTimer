# Event Timer

## A countdown timer with slide functionality

Born of a need for a countdown timer between sessions at a developer conference, [Event Timer](http://www.tapmymind.com/event-timer) provides a simple solution to showing remaining time before a seminar or meeting begins with the ability to cycle through image-based slides during the countdown.
